"""``/api/remote-control``: the personal Remote Control setting, its notice, one-click off.

``GET`` reports what the setting asks for, whether the Kiro sign-in allows it, the
notice to show when it does not, and whether the relay is connected now.

``PUT {"enabled": false}`` is one-click off: it writes an explicit ``false`` (so it
stays off across a restart), answers, and then stops a running relay once the
relay's open requests (this one's answer included) are done, within
:data:`~kiro_crew.remote_control.guard.DRAIN_SECONDS`. Turning off never needs a
restart. The dashboard cannot turn Remote Control on: ``{"enabled": true}`` is
refused with 400 and writes nothing; that is the terminal command's job
(``kirocrew remote-control on``).

Both verbs are owner-only.
