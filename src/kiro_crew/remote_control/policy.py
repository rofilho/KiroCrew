"""Which Kiro sign-ins may hold personal Remote Control, and what the person is told.

Personal Remote Control publishes this Crew to its owner's own Kiro account, so it
needs a sign-in that names a person. Two kinds do not:

* an API key (``KIRO_API_KEY``, or a stored credential whose provider is
  ``ApiKey``) is a bearer with no person behind it;
* an external identity provider sign-in (``auth_method`` or provider
  ``external_idp``) is an organisation's own IdP, which the lease service cannot
  bind to a personal Kiro account.

The rule is an allowlist, not a denylist: a provider this module does not know is
refused as ``unknown`` rather than let through, so a sign-in kind added later stays
off until someone decides it may hold Remote Control.

The rule is for PERSONAL Remote Control only. A team Crew
(``tunnel.relay_lease_token_type: "API_KEY"``) leases with its own crew API key,
which does not depend on the Kiro sign-in, so it is never refused here.

Where kiro-cli owns the sign-in (:func:`~kiro_crew.auth.whoami.vault_owns_sign_in`
is false and Crew's vault is empty), the sign-in is classified from
``kiro-cli whoami``'s ``accountType`` instead of Crew's vault.

:func:`allowed` is pure. :func:`current_decision` reads the vault and config
(blocking IO, call it off the event loop), may run ``kiro-cli whoami`` on the
kiro-cli route, and never refreshes a token.
