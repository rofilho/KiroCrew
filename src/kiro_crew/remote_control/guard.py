"""Keep the running relay in step with the Remote Control setting and the sign-in.

``tunnel.relay_enabled`` picks the relay client at boot, so the field is marked
restart-only. Turning Remote Control OFF must not wait for a restart, and neither
may a sign-in that stops being allowed. :class:`RemoteControlGuard` runs in the
gateway beside the tunnel manager and, every :data:`POLL_SECONDS`:

* stops the relay through :meth:`TunnelManager.stop` whenever it is running but
  the setting is off or the sign-in is refused (level-triggered, so a stop that
  failed is retried);
* starts it again through :meth:`TunnelManager.start` only on the tick the inputs
  CHANGE to "on and allowed" (edge-triggered, so a relay that cannot start is not
  retried every few seconds, and a stop the gateway made at shutdown is never
  undone).

Starting is only ever done through the tunnel manager the gateway built after
``tunnel/setup.py`` passed its token-auth and ``--no-tunnel`` gates, so the guard
cannot open a path those gates refused. It does nothing when the relay was not
selected at boot: there is no relay provider to start, and turning Remote Control
on then takes a restart.

The sign-in is re-read only when the vault's sign-in or sign-out marker moves
(:func:`~kiro_crew.remote_control.policy.sign_in_generation`); a token refresh
moves neither. Every file read runs off the event loop.
